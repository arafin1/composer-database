# composer-database

This program will allow us to manage a database of composers and relevant information about them. The features of the program include:

1. The ability to add a new composer
2. The ability to rank a composer (i.e., indicate how much we like or dislike the composer's music)
3. The ability to view all the composers in the database
4. The ability to view all composers by rank
